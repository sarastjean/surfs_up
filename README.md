After reviewing the statistical analysis for June and December in the data set, the average rainfall for the month of June was .14 and .22 for December across all years and stations. This proves that the seasonality might affect the ice cream shop as tourists tend to visit Hawaii when weather conditions are the most ideal also known as peak season. During the winter months, we could assume that the customers might also be more locals than tourists, which they might want to consider for their products. Also, the standard deviation for June is lower at .34 compared to December’s .54, meaning that the days with rain fall closer to June’s average of .14. According to the Weather Channel, rain around .1 (of an inch of rain) is very light and only lasts 30-45 minutes with small puddles that disappear. Rain below (.25) of an inch of rain is light rain for 2-3 hours with small puddles that might take longer to disappear.

To further give insight to the weather patterns, I would also recommend reviewing the temperatures during the year compared to the rain. Sometimes it rains but it is still hot outside, not exactly deterring customers from eating ice cream.  December is typically the low season for Hawaii, but with any business that caters to tourists there will be off-peak times. I would also review the data to see how he rainfall has changed by month over the years to look for consistencies and patterns.
